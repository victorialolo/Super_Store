## Data Transformation

Data cleaning and transformation was carried out using Power Query. After scrutinizing all columns, they were found to be valid and devoid of empty cells and errors. However, it was highly important that i transform the [Date] column which was in the 'date/time' format.

Therefore, i created 4 new columns all extracted from the data column as my calendar date

-  The first column contained the date this was marked as 'date' format(ie dd/mm/yyy).
-  The second column contains the Month column.
-  Month No was extracted help with the sorting month hierarchy.
-  The next is the year column
-  The column for quarter was also created.
